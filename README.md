# Arduino-Projects
Here everyone can find most of the Arduino project codes to use them directly in any of your projects without any errors. These are the work of my entire four years in engineering by doing y own DIY projects for me and others too.


Most of the time when i got struck in some projetc sgithub and other developer forums helped me a lot to complete my projects. So now i wanted to help my fellow beings. 

Every project in the above folder are complete coding without any errors because they are the final outcome of my projects. If you encounter some errors while compiling tose code, it might be because of the issues like (library unaddded, board issue, board unadded, using some nightly version of arduino will not suitable for Node mcu projects etc).

So feel free the contact me at anytime whenever you want help from above projects. Get my contact from my GitId.
